COLUMNS AND ROWS
when splitting rows use:

xs = extra small screens (Iphone lul)
sm = small screens (phones)
md = medium screens (tablets and laptops)
lg = large screens (desktop)

To achieve the same look across all platforms use xs, this will force the grid to appear the same down to the smallest size.
E.G: 
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-4">.col-xs-4</div>
  <div class="col-xs-4">.col-xs-4</div>
  <div class="col-xs-4">.col-xs-4</div>
</div>

the final number in the .col class decides how much of the page that column will span, ach row can have a max widtyh of 12.

the contents of that column must then be stated within the column's div.

DEFAULT FONT SIZES AND ATTRIBUTES
Default font size is 16px in the body and all p tags, there is also a 5px margin at the bottom of all text to allow for spacing.

HEADING SIZES:
h1 = 36px,     h2 = 30px,     h3 = 24px,     h4 = 18px,     h5 = 14px,     h6 = 12px.

the 'small' class can be used to create subheading within any heading 
E.G:     
<h1>h1 heading <small>secondary text</small></h1>

the 'mark' class will highlight text
E.G: 
 <p>Use the mark element to <mark>highlight</mark> text.</p>

The 'abbr' class can be used to mark abreviations in text or give more information when the cursor is above the selected text. The abbr must be given a title in it's opening tag.
E.G: 
<p>The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948.</p>

For making lists with descriptions use 'dt' for the description title and 'dd' for the description in the list.
E.G:
  <dl>
    <dt>Coffee</dt>
    <dd>- black hot drink</dd>
    <dt>Milk</dt>
    <dd>- white cold drink</dd>
  </dl>     

.list-unstyled = to remove list styling

.dl-horizontal = to switch all lists in a dl tag to be aligned horizontally.


the 'pre' tag allows for a block of text that can oboth preserve line breaks and spaces, using the tag pre-scrollable also alows the text to be scrolled through if it exceeds 350px.
