## Notes, things, stuff, and notes about things to note down, that should probably (will actually) be created/organised
- Make separate Linux and Win10 + NGINX and DBs + VSCode dev env setup guide (This is mostly aimed at potential students starting the same uni degree I did)
- Make a basic Git guide
- Make a basic CI/CD guide
- For web dev, in Edge you can have a 3D view of the web page. Firefox used to have this feature. *used to*
- Compile a list of dev tools I use (PowerTools colour picker, Firefox `Developer` dropdown options, Firefox `(F12) Developer Tools` and extensions, and general Firefox extension).
- Make digestible notes here about some of the contents in `example-configs`. Also, probably expand `example-configs` with some Linux/NGINX/MySQL/MariaDB/PHP configs and reference them here.
